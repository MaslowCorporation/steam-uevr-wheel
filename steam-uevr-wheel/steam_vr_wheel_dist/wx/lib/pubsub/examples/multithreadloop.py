"""
This test gives an example of how some computation results from an
auxiliary thread could be 'published' via pubsub in a thread-safe
manner, in a 'gui'-like application, ie an application where the
main thread is in an infinite event loop and supports the callback
of user-defined functions when the gui is idle.

The worker thread 'work' is to increment a counter
as fast as interpreter can handle. Every so often (every resultStep counts),
the thread stores the count in a synchronized queue, for later retrieval
by the main thread. In parallel to this, the main thread loops forever (or
until user interrupts via keyboard), doing some hypothetical work
(represented by the sleep(1) call) and calling all registered 'idle'
callbacks. The transfer is done by extracting items from the queue and
publishing them via pubsub.
