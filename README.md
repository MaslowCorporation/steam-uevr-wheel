Hi, this repository contains a UEVR plugin that allows you to enjoy VR steering in UEVR games ;-)

### Note for users

This plugin has been made by me, because I'm tired of waiting for Mark Zuckerberg's implementation of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas in VR ;-)

If you want to get up and running with this plugin in GTA SAN ANDREAS: DE, follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/MaslowCorporation/GTA-SAN-ANDREAS-VR) designed to turn Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Definitive Edition into a fun VR experience, to see an example of this plugin in action.

Please note that this plugin can be used in ANY driving UEVR game, not just Grand Theft Auto ;-)

#### Quick tutorial for users

##### STEP 1

First, Make sure that you use the latest UEVR (version 1.04) 

because the plugin doesn't work on older versions (1.03 and under). 

You can get the latest UEVR version as a zip file in the releases section of UEVR

https://github.com/praydog/UEVR/releases

##### STEP 2

Once you have UEVR version 1.04 ready, make sure you inject UEVR at least once in your desired game, so the UEVR game folders get generated at `C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\AppData\Roaming\UnrealVRMod`

##### STEP 3

Download the `steam-uevr-wheel.zip` file from the Releases page of steam-uevr-wheel ,

then unzip this file. Once unzipped, you'll get a `steam-uevr-wheel` folder that contains some .bat files, a DEV_INSTALL.md file, and 2 folders. 

Place this steam-uevr-wheel folder in your Documents folder. 

IMPORTANT NOTE !!: 

After the unzipping of `steam-uevr-wheel.zip` , if you get a `steam-uevr-wheel` folder that contains another `steam-uevr-wheel` folder, then get the CHILD `steam-uevr-wheel folder`, NOT THE PARENT `steam-uevr-wheel folder`.

Your `steam-uevr-wheel` folder MUST BE located at `C:\Users\YOUR_WINDOWS_USER_NAME\Documents\steam-uevr-wheel`

##### STEP 4

Inside this `steam-uevr-wheel` folder, there's a `steam-uevr-wheel.bat` file. 

If you did everything right, the steam-uevr-wheel.bat file MUST BE located at this path

`C:\Users\YOUR_WINDOWS_USER_NAME\Documents\steam-uevr-wheel\steam-uevr-wheel.bat`

If yours is located at 

`C:\Users\YOUR_WINDOWS_USER_NAME\Documents\steam-uevr-wheel\steam-uevr-wheel\steam-uevr-wheel.bat`

Then you didn't follow the IMPORTANT NOTE of STEP 3, the `steam-uevr-wheel` folder should NOT be nested ;-)

##### STEP 5

Double click this file to open steam-uevr-wheel.
One or more command line windows will open. On the first opening, you'll get an error No such file or directory: 'C:\\Users\\YOUR_USERNAME\\AppData\\Local\\steam-vr-wheel\\config.json' Load default? . Choose Yes.

Once you have loaded the default config.json file, close all the command line windows that opened, and also close the other configuration window that opened (the Steam Vr Wheel Configuration window where you can set Degrees and other settings)

##### STEP 6

Okay ! Now, you need to install a tool called vjoy

Download and install the latest `vJoySetup.exe` from this sourceforge.net page

https://sourceforge.net/projects/vjoystick/

You will be prompted to restart the computer to finish the installation. Restart your computer.

Once the computer has restarted, a final window will show up to finish the installation. Follow through.

##### STEP 7

Once VJoy is installed successfully, you need to download and add the `VRHands` UEVR plugin to your UEVR game folder.

Download the `VRHands.dll` and `libzmq-mt-gd-4_3_5.dll` files from the Releases page of steam-uevr-wheel ,

Open your UEVRInjector.exe as admin, and click on `Open Global Dir` . It will open a File Explorer to the location where the UEVR game folders are. 

This location typically is `C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\AppData\Roaming\UnrealVRMod` 

Locate the GameFolder folder, and copy paste your VRHands.dll and libzmq-mt-gd-4_3_5.dll files inside the GameFolder/plugins folder.
(NOTE: GameFolder is the name of the folder of your UEVR game. It's not literally GameFolder, it varies given your game, so figure it out ;-)

Mission accomplished ;-) You have installed everything needed to use VR motion controls for cars/trucks/boats !

Using the VR steering wheel in-game is very simple.

FIrst, press the Shift key on your keyboard, to get in Wheel Setup mode.
This mode allows you to position and resize the wheel the way you want it to be.
Press the left and right VR trigger buttons, and move your hands around and you'll see the wheel following your hand movements.
Get your hands apart from each other, and you'll see the wheel growing bigger, and vice versa when you get your hands closer together.

Once you're satisfied with the wheel size and position, press the Shift key on your keyboard, to get in Wheel Visible mode.
Now your wheel is actually ready to work ;-)
Press your left or right controller VR grip button to turn/steer the wheel. ;-)

(IMPORTANT !!) If the wheel is not properly aligned in-game, simply recenter your SteamVR position
On Oculus headsets, press the left VR controller's menu button, to make the SteamVR VR menu appear,
then click the Recenter button in the bottom bar of the VR menu on-screen.
A countdown will appear. Look in the direction where you want the recenter to be made, and that's it. The steam-uevr-wheel will be properly recentered ;-)

### Note for Developers

* To get up and running with the C++ side of steam-uevr-wheel, follow [this tutorial](./readme_assets/create_uevr_plugin/README.md)

* To make edits to the steam-uevr-wheel python program, 
the file containing the core wheel logic is [_wheel.py](./steam-uevr-wheel-dev/steam_vr_wheel/_wheel.py) , 
so edit this file to your heart's desire, if you know what you're doing ;-)

### Thank you for existing ;-)
